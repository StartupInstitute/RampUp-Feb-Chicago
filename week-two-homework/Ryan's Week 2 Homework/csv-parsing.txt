Assignment 2

The first line is loading the csv library, allowing the code to use methods from that library. 

In the second line, the variable "f" is being set to the File.read method, which is a CSV method that loads a .csv file (in this case, specifically sample.csv)

In the third line, the variable "parsed" is being created and set to the CSV.parse method which is using the variable "f" as the .csv file.

What the variable parsed is doing in the forth line is creating an array, and putting each line of the csv file in an array, the "parse" method of CSV

What the variable parsed[0] is doing in the fifth line is creating an array, and putting row "[0]", the first row of the csv file, in that array.

What the variable parsed[0][0] is doing in the sixth line is finding row "[0]", the first row of the csv file, and is designating the first string, "[0]" of that first row.

What the variable parsed[1][0] is doing in the seventh line is finding row "[1]", the second row of the csv file, and is designating the first string, "[0]" of that first row.
